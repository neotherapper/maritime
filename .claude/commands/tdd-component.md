Create React component following TDD methodology:

1. Analyze component requirements from $ARGUMENTS
2. Write comprehensive failing tests, including interaction tests within Storybook using the play function (think about edge cases)
3. Implement minimal component code to pass all tests, ensuring correct rendering in Storybook.
4. Refactor for code quality while maintaining green tests and preventing visual regressions in Storybook.
5. Generate TypeScript interfaces and use Storybook to create living, interactive documentation.
